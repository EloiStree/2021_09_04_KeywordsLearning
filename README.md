# 2021_09_04_KeywordsLearning
For me, education should not be based on answers but on keywords to explore. 

(This project is a reminder that I need to code this package in a near future.)

The idea is to provide XML <-> C# storage of knowedge in form of keywords research on search engines: Google/Bing/... , Youtube/Odysee... , Wikipedia...

- In first version it would be use in my Pecha Kucha project.
- In second version it would be use an a learning tree module.
